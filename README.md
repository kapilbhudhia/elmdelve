explore and learn elm

Brief Introduction:
This is an attempt at learning elm with small fun little projects. Currently there is only one example in the repository - DelayedShapes.

DelayedShapes idea is stolen from http://elm-by-example.org/chapter7delayedcircles.html. It makes heavy use of elm Signals, if you are new to functional programming you might want to first get an introduction to functional programming before attempting to understand DelayedShapes. 

Running the examples:
install elm, start elm-reactor in the directory containing the file DelayedShapes.elm and then visit the page http://0.0.0.0:8000 in your browser, elm-reactor will download the necessary packages and present the web-page. Click the DelayedCircles.elm link in your browser and have fun.
